Mission Statement
“To make new disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world.”

Love one another
We follow the teachings of Jesus to love one another by extending grace and acceptance to all.

“A new command I give you: love one another. As I have loved you, so must you love one another.” (John 13:34) NIV



Missions
Our missions share love, compassion, and teachings of Jesus through making an impact and transforming lives in our community and around the world.

“For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.” (Matthew 25:35-36) NIV


International Faith Development
We encourage and offer opportunities to help all find and develop a personal relationship with God.

“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come; the old has gone, the new is here!” (2 Corinthians 5:17) NIV



Excellence
We strive to fulfill, with excellence, all tasks given to us in order to glorify the God we serve.

“In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and give the glory to your Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:16) NIV
